				<h3>Welcome!</h3>
				<br>
				<p id="p2">We are a Christian organization that exists to increase the Biblical literacy of local men,
					and to give them the tools to survive in an ever-changing world. Specializing
					in working with the intimidated and introverted, we meet you where you are, both
					physically, and metaphysically.</p>
					<br>
				<p id="p3">Physically, we meet you where you want to meet -
					coffee shop, the track, your work break-room. Metaphysically, we meet you where
					you are in faith and Biblical knowledge. Are you agnostic with questions? Contact us. Are you
					a new Christian struggling to understand it all? Call us. Are you interested, but you
					don't own a Bible? We've got one for you. Since we exist to serve, meeting us doesn't cost you
					a cent more than the food or drink you choose to order while we talk.</p>
					<br>
				<p id="p4">Don't put it off any longer - today is the day! Check out our programs below to find one that works for you. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="banner">We now carry a selection of Christian <a href="product.html">products</a>! Check out our <a href="product.html">products</a> link at the top of the page to find great reads.</p>

			<div class="box first desc">
				<p>This is our most basic service. We work with you to help you
					understand Biblical concepts in a place the works for you, and at a pace
					that is comfortable for you. Think of it as Church, without church.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box second desc">
				<p>We meet once a week to share some food, learn as a group,
					and get to know each other. This service is intended for those
					men who are not comfortable meeting one-to-one, or for those who
					are ready to learn in a group.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box third desc">
				<p>This program is designed for those who have a firm understanding
					of their faith, and ready to learn to explain it to others. Just like
					martial arts training, but with ideas. Here, we learn to politely defend
					your faith by learning the arguments against it. This is not for the faint of heart!</p>
