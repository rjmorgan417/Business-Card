				<!-- Basic information. Not required for the assignment, but added to provide context. -->
				<p>My wife Monica and I live in Battlefield, Missouri with our two daughters, Makenna and Madeline. Both Monica and I grew up in Springfield,
				graduating from Kickapoo High School in 1990 and 1991, respectively.</p>
				<p>I retired from the Army in November of 2018 following 23 years of active service. In those years, we (the family) lived in multiple US states,
				and I (with the Army) visited lots of cool places, and completed overseas tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and South Korea. The last job I held in the Army was the commander of
				the 2nd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Irwin, California. Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Armored_Cavalry_Regiment#2nd_Squadron" target="_blank">here</a>
				to learn a little about the 2nd Squadron and the "Blackhorse Regiment".</p>
				<p>I'm currently pursuing OTC's Certificate of Achievement in Computer Programming, and I'm doing so for a few reasons. One, I like computers. I'm not a computer
				prodigy by any stretch of the imagination, but I enjoy using them. Two, I like problem solving. Three, finally, I want to learn some new skills to start my next career.</p>

				<h3>This Year's Exciting Holiday</h3>
				<p> I got braces on my teeth in January of 2018. According to the orthodontist who installed them, I was only supposed to have them for six months. The plan was to straighten
				my teeth and then have some follow-on dental work done, all before I retired from the Army. Well, my retirement date came and went. The doctor apologized for his miscalculations,
				and I left the Army, still wearing goverment-supplied dental-metal. Time creeped by, as it does when you wear braces. It seemed to me that these things would never go away.</p>
				<p>Then it happened. During my routine visit just before Christmas, when I least expected it, my orthodontist began to remove those little brackets, one-by-one. Sure, having bonded
				metal ripped from your teeth is not pleasant. However, the joy of finally being freed from those tiny steel oppressors, was, to quote cousin Eddie, "the gift that keeps on giving." </p>
